        <h1>About this site</h1>
        <p>
            This site tracks the status and evolution of <strong>selected</strong> clans on the <a href="http://console.worldoftanks.com/">World of Tanks</a> game, for XBOX and PlayStation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The monitoring is done daily by collecting, along each day, information about the clans' members on the <a title="just an example" href="https://developers.wargaming.net/reference/xbox/wotx/clans/info/?application_id=demo&clan_id=208&r_realm=xbox" rel="nofollow">Wargaming API</a>,
            and then, for each clan member, query <i>by tank overall</i> performance, store this data on a database an then compute WN8, Win Rate etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest is just simple math using weighted averages by the number of battles.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site <b>is not</b> real-time! Clans are calculated daily, but players has data refreshed on intervals ranging from 24h (active player, top WN8t15 clan) to 15 days (inactive player, very small clan, and smaller WN8t15).

        <h3>About the reported statistics</h3>

        <p name="aboutWn8">
            WN8 is a statistic shows how good, in a given tank, a player is, compared to other players on the same tank.
            The full <a href="http://wiki.wnefficiency.net/pages/WN8">calculation method</a> is boring, but it is considered consistent
            with the win rate of a particular player.
        </p>
        <p>
            WN8 values around 1,000 are midfielders, and above and below are better and worst values, respectively.
            These values are <a href="http://wotinfo.net/en/wn8scale">divided into ratings</a>, and each rating with a color and name as below:

            A commander is <strong>active</strong> if he/she plays at least 21 matches on the last month (actually, the last 28 days).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Recent Win Rate</strong> and <strong>Recent WN8s</strong> are calculated using only <strong>active</strong> commanders of each clan,
            weighing the individual statistics by the number of battles performed on the last month.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><abbr>WN8a</abbr>: it's the weighted <strong>monthly</strong> WN8 of <strong>all</strong> <strong>active</strong> commanders;</li>
            <li><abbr>WN8t15</abbr>: it's the weighted <strong>monthly</strong> WN8 of the <strong>top 15</strong> <strong>active</strong> commanders;</li>
            <li><abbr>WN8t7</abbr>: it's the weighted <strong>monthly</strong> WN8 of the <strong>top 7</strong> <strong>active</strong> commanders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The individual ranking of a commander inside the clan is based on the monthly WN8.
            This choice makes the ranking more dynamic, reflecting a more up to date reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clan ranking is based on the <abbr title="it's the weighted monthly WN8 of the top 15active commanders">WN8t15</abbr>. This yields a more
            dynamic picture of the <i>scene</i> and avoids cheating by <i>Re-enroll</i>; and it will not encourage clans to climb in the ranking <b>exclusively</b>
            through the <i>elimination of the weakest</i>. My explicit intention is to stimulate larger clans,
            with an elite teaching a larger base how to play better and better.

            <h4>Suspect Data</h4>
            <p>
                This site is the end point of a chain of information that flows from the <a href="http://console.worldoftanks.com/">Wargaming</a>'s
                battle servers to the <a href="http://console.worldoftanks.com/">Wargaming</a>'s web API servers,
                and finally to the my data collectors. If at any point there is data corruption, lag or inconsistencies, the information on this site will be affected.
            </p>
            <p>
                I try to detect suspicious data, filtering out outliers in the recent WN8 of each player.
                The name of a player will be in <span class="suspectData">red</span> if an outlier was detected, and the value of the
                reported recent WN8 will come from the previous collection, which is, hopefully, better information. Usually the problem solves by itself in few days.
            </p>

<section class="row" id="caveats">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3 title="Warnings!">Caveats</h3>
        <p>
            Any statistics should be taken carefully. Don't be (very) upset if you (or your clan) has a low WN8: the game's objetive is to be fun to play,
            and if you (and your clan) became good at it, the better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Large portion of the statistics are collected in public matches, often even playing in platoon.
            So these numbers are not accurate predictors of a battle of clans, where greater coordination is required and possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a clan is added to the system it takes a full month of data collection for the recent values (last month)
            became comparable with those of other clans.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 1em;">
            Not all clans of the game are represented on this site. If you want your clan be included, <a href="#addClan">ask me</a>.
            Even if a clan is being tracked it only appears in listing if it has at least 7 active commanders and at least 25% of all commanders are active.

        <h3>Adding your clan</h3>
        <p>
            There's a daily routine that automatically adds clans that reach at least 7 members. Usually they appear on the site a few days after being added.
            If you think it's not working, <a href="#aboutme">call me on Discord</a> so I check what's going on. 
            Remember that the default view, on the main page, only shows clans with at least 7 active members. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If your clan goes inactive for a long time, or with less than 5 members, I will disable data collection for it and it will soon vanishes from the site. 
            <a href="#aboutme">Write to me</a> if your clan was back on the game and the system didn't automatically detected it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clan <strong>must</strong> have at least 7 members. I will not add clans with less than 7 members.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Flag:</b> are completely optional. If you want to change the flag of your clan, 
            <a href="~/Flags">choose one</a> and tell me (<a href="#aboutme">by Discord</a>) their code.
            Only officials of the can ask me that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can add clans to the site on my discretion, usually if the clan enters a tournament, or if it catches my attention in the battlefield.
